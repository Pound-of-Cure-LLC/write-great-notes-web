git commit and push all uncommited changes, then use ghwatch to monitor the deployment, if there are any errors, fix them, commit and push again, then watch the deployment to make sure it goes through successfully. Itereate as many times as necessary. After the deployment finishes, issue a command like this;  gh release create v0.1.4 --title "v0.1.4" --notes "Initial deployment" --repo Pound-of-Cure-LLC/write-great-notes-web - review the commit and if it was a major addition to the website (ie new page, new major feature), increase the minor version, ie 0.1.4-->0.2.0, otherwise, incrememnt the last number, ie 0.1.5
