## Writing Style

### Avoid AI-Generated Content "Smells"

When writing content for this project, avoid patterns that are commonly associated with AI-generated text:

- **Do NOT use em dashes (—)** - Use regular dashes with spaces instead (" - ")
  - Bad: "I've been practicing medicine—most recently in Tucson—for 20 years"
  - Good: "I've been practicing medicine - most recently in Tucson - for 20 years"
